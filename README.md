# MSDNet-for-Medical-Image-Fusion
Accepted in:The 10th International Conference on Image and Graphics(ICIG2019)

## Abstract
Considering the DenseFuse only works in a single scale, we propose a multi-scale DenseNet(MSDNet) for medical image fusion. The
main architecture of network is constructed by encoding network, fusion layer and decoding network. To utilize features at different scales, we add a multi-scale mechanism which uses three filters of different sizes to extract features in encoding network. More image details are obtained by increasing the encoding networkâ€™s width. Then, we adopt fusion strategy to fuse features of different scales respectively. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by decoding network. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art fusion performance in objective and subjective assessment.
